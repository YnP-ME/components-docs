# Chat / Assistant Interface

## Overview

The Chat component provides a conversational assistant interface that integrates alerts, suggestions, and free-form messaging. It acts as a contextual helper, enabling users to interact with system alerts, receive AI-generated suggestions, and ask questions directly in a familiar chat format.

## Key Features

- **Assistant panel:** persistent layout with header, alerts, message history, and input box.
- **Alerts integration:** clickable alert list that can drill into specific contexts.
- **Message suggestions:** message list supporting clickable suggestions for quick actions.
- **Auto-pilot mode:** toggle switch that activates automated responses/actions when tied to a cluster.
- **User input field:** text input with send button for free-form interaction.
- **UI transitions:** smooth fade animations for better user experience.

## Usage Scenarios

- Monitoring dashboards where alerts trigger assistant responses and allow direct drill-down.
- Operator workflows where auto-pilot can assist by pre-suggesting or executing actions.
- Support tools where users can chat with an assistant to clarify data or request actions.

## Accessibility

- Back button and toggle controls have clear labels and icons.
- Input placeholder guides users on how to interact.
- Ensure all actions (alerts, suggestions, send button) are keyboard accessible.

## Theming & Styling

- Dark theme styling (`bg-slate-800`, `text-slate-100`) for seamless integration with dashboards.
- Accent colors (pink switch, brand-blue send button) highlight key actions.
- Smooth fade animations distinguish transitions (alerts, back navigation).

## Performance Considerations

- Alerts and messages are fetched via hooks; ensure efficient pagination or polling if datasets grow.
- Minimize re-renders by controlling state updates only for active alert and auto-pilot states.
- Optimize scrolling in the message list when many messages are present (e.g., virtualization).
